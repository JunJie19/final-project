The repository for the final year project 2017

## Project proposal
  - Introduction/background
  - The problem + overview/literature review: related software, app, website, and academic publications
  - Your (project) idea
  - Plan
    - 3 iterations: 
      - each iteration has requirements, design, implementation, and evaluation.
      - first iteration: paper prototype
      - second iteration: working prototype with minimal function
      - third iteration: fully working prototype
    - A list of deliverables and deadlines are fine

## GitHub.com
Use github.com for project file and code (Kai)
  - 'Code': report and implementation code
  - 'Issues': tasks and coding issue
  - 'Projects': planning and project management
  - 'Wiki': notes, meetings, reports, and any other documentation
  - How to use git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 (first 2 chapters)

## Code editor (IDE): 
Recommended: Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

Much better for JavaScript development than Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/), or Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## Latex
Use Latex instead of Word for all the reports: proposal, progress report, final report, and viva.
